	<p>This is the Philosophy page. This is where my design philosophy is. Click on the links to move around.</p>
	<p>My design philosophy is that the purpose of design to solve issues. It is an imaginative progression that fulfills a need to the people who interact with it. Those people who interact with it should be delighted when coming across the design. Empathy is the channel to great design because it roots it in reality. The purpose of design is to be clear in purpose. Sometimes design evolves to meet changes in expectations that people have, and sometimes design is the driver of change. Having a varied set of tools and knowing when to use them is the art of design.</p>
